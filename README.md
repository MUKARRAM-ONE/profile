### What I already pulled from your resume and the links
- Added projects and posts that mirror the examples on anaskhan.com (project detail page 'stellar-sync' and blog post 'mastering-server-components').
- Filled the Home page 'What I Do' and summary with your resume info: AI & Computer Vision, Next.js, TypeScript, cloud/WSL focus, current learning (cloud computing, agentic AI using OpenAI SDKs).



### Next steps I completed for you now
1. Created full site scaffolding (above). It mirrors the structure and pages you asked for.
2. Integrated your resume contact info and links.
3. Added a small data layer (data/projects.ts and data/posts.ts) so you can easily edit content.
